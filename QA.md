### Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority vs Scope Sales Pvt. Ltd. 2026 INSC 89

**Question:** What overarching principle guides the High Court in the exercise of its discretionary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution?
**Answer:** The primary guiding principle is that the remedy of a writ is discretionary in nature, and relief may be denied even if a strong legal case exists if the grant of such relief would not **serve or advance public interest**. High Courts, as custodians of the Constitution, must maintain social balance and decline jurisdiction if interference would result in more harm to society.

**Question:** What is the specific standard required for an intra-court appellate Bench to interfere with a Single Judge’s order?
**Answer:** Interference in an intra-court appeal is warranted only where the judgment or order under challenge is **demonstrably erroneous or suffers from perversity**. The appellate Bench ought not to substitute its own view merely because it considers its view to be better, so long as the view taken by the Single Judge is a plausible and reasonable one.

**Question:** In cases where individual rights conflict with the needs of institutions critical for national development (like IITs), which interest must prevail?
**Answer:** While individual rights merit due respect, they cannot be placed on a pedestal higher than the collective public interest. Where individual interest and the larger public good conflict (such as the need for land for essential institutions like IITs), the **individual interest must necessarily yield** to the larger public good.

### XXX v. State of Kerala 2026 INSC 88

**Question:** Under Section 175(4) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), what discretion does a Judicial Magistrate retain regarding a complaint against a public servant?
**Answer:** Upon receiving a complaint alleging an offense by a public servant, the Magistrate has three options:
1. **Mandatory Following of S. 175(4):** If the Magistrate is *prima facie satisfied* that the offense arose in the course of discharging official duties, the procedure under S. 175(4) must be followed (calling for reports).
2. **Cautionary Following of S. 175(4):** If the Magistrate entertains a *prima facie doubt* regarding the nexus, they may err on the side of caution and follow S. 175(4).
3. **General Procedure (S. 175(3)):** If the Magistrate is *satisfied* that the alleged act was not committed in the discharge of official duties or bears no reasonable nexus thereto, they may proceed under the general procedure prescribed by S. 175(3).

**Question:** What limits are placed on a High Court exercising Article 226 jurisdiction when reviewing judicial orders passed in criminal matters?
**Answer:** A judicial order in a civil matter, and by extension, in a criminal matter, cannot typically be challenged in a writ petition under Article 226. Furthermore, a writ court exercising high prerogative jurisdiction cannot convert itself into a court for conducting a magisterial inquiry or embark on a fact-finding exercise to determine if an offense arose in the discharge of official duties if the originating judicial order itself is not challenged.

**Question:** How should a statutory proviso be interpreted in relation to its main provision?
**Answer:** A proviso is an internal aid to construction that should be read to embrace only the field covered by the main provision. It functions to **carve out an exception** to that main provision, and to no other. A useful test is whether the provision would still be capable of application if the main provision were removed; if so, it cannot normally be considered a proviso.

### Premium Transmission Private Limited v. State of Maharashtra 2026 INSC 87

**Question:** What authority does the appropriate Government have under Section 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act regarding the reference of disputes?
**Answer:** If a case falls within the second limb of Section 10(1), the appropriate Government is within its jurisdiction to refer an **apprehended dispute** (in addition to existing disputes) to the Board, Labour Court, or Tribunal for adjudication.

**Question:** In cases alleging sham or nominal contracts, what must the Labour Court establish before granting other relief?
**Answer:** Adjudicatory relief establishing the **status of the workman vis-à-vis the principal employer** is a *sine qua non* (an indispensable condition) for the grant of any other relief. Even if an unfair labour practice is alleged, the fundamental issue of the employer-employee relationship must first be resolved by the Labour Court under the ID Act.

### Niraj Jain v. Competent Authority‑ cum‑ Additional Collector, Jagdalpur 2026 INSC 86

**Question:** Where compensation awards in a land acquisition project are annulled due to corruption involving specific landowners and officials, does that annulment apply universally to innocent landowners?
**Answer:** No. The Supreme Court held that judicial and administrative orders annulling an award based on collusion and excessive compensation must operate only against the **specifically implicated landowners**. Such annulment cannot affect an appellant who was neither accused of wrongdoing nor made a party to those proceedings.

**Question:** What was the consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling for the non-tainted landowner (the appellant)?
**Answer:** The Supreme Court restored the original award and the subsequent arbitral enhancement in favour of the appellant, directing the Competent Authority to disburse the entire balance compensation, along with applicable interest and solatium, within three months.

### Bernard Lyngdoh Phawa v. State of Meghalaya 2026 INSC 85

**Question:** What criteria must a statement meet to be considered a confession capable of forming the sole basis for a conviction?
**Answer:** A confession must be a **direct acknowledgment of guilt** of the offence in question, sufficient by itself for conviction. The Court must be satisfied that it was **true and voluntarily made**, and it should typically be corroborated. A statement that merely provides incriminating facts that tend to prove guilt, but falls short of plenary acknowledgment, is not a confession.

**Question:** What is the legal implication of relying on an exculpatory statement made by one accused against a co-accused?
**Answer:** Exculpatory statements made by one accused to absolve himself from liability and accuse a co-accused of having caused the death cannot be relied upon against the co-accused.

**Question:** What element must be established by the prosecution when using the ‘last seen together’ theory under Section 106 of the Evidence Act?
**Answer:** The ‘last seen together’ theory projected by the prosecution must be **proximate to the death of the victim**.

### Sri Mukund Maheswar v. Axis Bank Ltd 2026 INSC 84

**Question:** What is the proper judicial approach when a petitioner claims a relief in a writ petition that is larger or wider than what they are ultimately entitled to?
**Answer:** The writ petition cannot be dismissed solely on the ground that the petitioner claimed a larger relief. If the court finds the suitor entitled to a lesser relief than the larger or wider relief claimed, the court is permitted to grant such lesser relief. The High Court also has the power to **mould relief** without insisting on an amendment of the prayer clause.

**Question:** What limitation did the Supreme Court place on the High Court Registry regarding objections to the array of parties in a writ petition?
**Answer:** The Registry cannot make inroads into areas that fall within the exclusive domain of the judiciary. It is the petitioner’s prerogative to decide who to join as a party, and the Registry cannot seek clarification as to the reason for joining a particular respondent. Issues concerning unnecessary parties (related to principles under Order I Rule 10, CPC) must be dealt with on the judicial side.

**Question:** What legal principle is encapsulated by the maxim *“Fraus omnia corrumpit”*?
**Answer:** The maxim means **“Fraud unravels everything.”**
